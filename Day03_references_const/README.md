# 🚀 Modern C++ – 30 Days Learning Journey

This repository documents my **30-day Modern C++ learning journey**, where I focus on
learning **one core concept daily** and implementing it using **clean, real-world C++ code**.

The goal is not just theory, but **strong fundamentals**, **best practices**, and
**industry-relevant skills** — especially useful for **DSA, system programming, and quantitative finance**.
