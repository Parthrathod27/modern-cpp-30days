## Day 1: auto & Type Deduction (Modern C++)

This example demonstrates how `auto` simplifies type deduction in C++.
It improves readability and reduces verbosity, especially when working
with STL containers, iterators, and function return values.

### Concepts Covered
- Basic type deduction
- const and reference behavior
- auto with function returns
- auto with STL containers
- Range-based for loops
