# Day 12 — Move Semantics (Modern C++)

## 📌 Topic
**Move Semantics & rvalue References**

This day focuses on understanding how Modern C++ optimizes performance
by transferring resources instead of copying them.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand move vs copy
- Learn rvalue references (`&&`)
- Use `std::move` correctly
- Understand Rule of 5 and Rule of 0

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Move constructor
- Move assignment operator
- rvalues vs lvalues
- Performance optimization

---

## 🚀 Why Move Semantics Matters
- Avoids unnecessary deep copies
- Enables efficient STL containers
- Core foundation of Modern C++

---

## 💬 Interview Takeaways
- "Move semantics transfers ownership"
- "`std::move` enables move, it doesn’t move"
- "Moved-from object remains valid"
