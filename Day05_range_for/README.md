# Day 5 — Range-Based for Loop (Modern C++)

## 📌 Topic
Range-based `for` loop simplifies iteration over containers.

## 🎯 Why use range-based for?
- No index handling
- Cleaner and readable syntax
- Works perfectly with STL containers

## 🧠 What this code explains
- Iterating over vector using range-based for
- Iterating over map using `auto`
- Comparison with traditional loops

## 📂 File
- `Day05_range_for_explained.cpp`

## ✅ Key Takeaway
Range-based for loops reduce bugs and improve readability in modern C++ code.
